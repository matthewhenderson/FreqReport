The purpose of this script is to get all the fields in a sqlite database, then, look at the distinct values appearing in that field.

Once that is done, the frequency each value occurs is calculated. 

A bar graph is produced in R, and a table is generated in an HTML file, showing the data for each field in the database.

May need to change setting of ENV['R_HOME'].
